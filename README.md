# Dependencies
- iOS: version 12.0~
- iPhone: 7~
- Leap Motion

    - providing hand gesture UX experiences. For example, you can watch your favorite movies in spaces around you, and change screen size using your hands. You can also search items in front of you in amazon.com.
- This is written in Swift using ARKit, but I rarely depended on ARKit's APIs and implemented most of the functions by myself because there are many functions that cannot be realized by existing ARKit libraries.
- I developed this application for a software development contest during the mechano-informatics class in 2019, and I won the 1st prize.
